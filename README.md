# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to compare the revenue Pyber recieves from fares on a weekly basis between different city types. 

## Results

There are a few different conclusions we can draw from this specific analysis. First, we can draw some conclusions from the following DataFrame:

|             | Total Rides	| Total Drivers | Total Fares	| Average Fare per Ride| 	Average Fare per Driver| 
| ----------- |:-----------:|:-------------:|:-----------:| :-------------------:| -----------------------:|   
| Rural	      | 125	        | 78	          | $4,327.93   | $34.62               |  $55.49                 | 
| Suburban	  | 625	        | 490	          | $19,356.33	| $30.97	             |  $39.50                 | 
| Urban	      | 1,625	      | 2,405         | $39,854.38  | $24.53               |  $16.57                 |    


From this table we can conclude that a majority of rides and drivers are in urban cities. Because a majority of total rides take place in urban areas, the total revenue from fares is from urban rides even though the average fare per ride is the lowest in urban areas.

When breaking this data down into a weekly basis, we see further that revenue from urban fares dominate the suburban and rural fare revenues.

## Summary

Based on the results of the analysis, there are three recommendations we can make to address the disparities among the city types.

  1. We can see that there are more total drivers in the urban area than rides that have been given over this four month period. Pyber should stop hiring drivers in urban areas until the number of rides outpaces total drivers available.
  2. On the other side of the coin we can see that there are less drivers available than total rides given in the suburban and rural cities. There is an opportunity to hire more drivers or shift urban drivers to suburban or rural areas to make up for this difference and provide a more reliable ride share opportunity in these areas.
  3. To incentivize drivers to work in suburban or rural areas, Pyber can reference the average fare per driver that is available outside the urban cities. It can be assumed that there is less competition among drivers in these areas that provide better opportunity to make more money as a driver. Furthermore, in suburban and rural areas, the trips are longer providing an opportunity for drivers to make more money per ride than in the urban center.
